# NFL Season Analysis Project

### Overview

## I delved into analyzing NFL seasons from the 1970s to the present day. By integrating statistical analysis, I aimed to gain deeper insights into the performance of NFL teams over the years.


### Project Highlights
Selected Season: NFL from 1970s to Present
Season Overview and Format: Explored major events, league structure, and team compositions.
Relevant Statistics: Analyzed key metrics to understand team performance.
Scoring Distributions: Examined scoring patterns through graphical and numeric summaries.
Pythagorean Win Percentage: Calculated and compared Pythagorean win percentages with actual outcomes.
Bradley-Terry Ratings: Utilized Bradley-Terry models to evaluate team strengths.
Elo Ratings: Tracked preseason and postseason Elo ratings for teams, identifying trends and outliers.
Monte Carlo Simulation: Simulated NFL seasons using Elo ratings and Monte Carlo simulation to compare with actual results.
Team Analysis: Investigated the performance of selected teams over the season based on Elo ratings and simulation outcomes.
Overachieving/Underachieving Teams: Identified and analyzed teams that surpassed or fell short of expectations.
Dataset and Tools
Dataset
I utilized the NFL dataset spanning from the 1970s to the present, sourced from Canvas. This comprehensive dataset provided game-by-game information and starting Elo ratings for each team.

Tools
To analyze the data and perform simulations, I used Python along with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy. Leveraging code from Lectures 15-22, I tailored the analysis to suit NFL statistics and dynamics.

Presentation Format
My final presentation is organized in a structured manner, covering each component of the project in detail. I opted for a cohesive document that combines graphical representations, tables, and textual analysis to convey my findings effectively.

Submission and Grading
I submitted my final project on December 15, 2023, meeting the deadline specified on Canvas. The project was graded based on various criteria, including accuracy, completeness, and presentation quality.

Conclusion
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in analyzing sports data and applying statistical techniques to derive meaningful insights. Exploring NFL seasons provided me with a deeper understanding of team dynamics, performance evaluation, and the importance of statistical modeling in sports analytics.

I'm excited to share my findings and contribute to the growing field of sports data analysis. Thank you for the opportunity to undertake this project, and I look forward to further explorations in the realm of statistical sports analysis.
